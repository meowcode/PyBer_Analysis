# Pyber_Analysis

## Overview of Project

Using data previously provided by Pyber, a summary of the ride-sharing data was created which included  "Total Rides", "Total Drivers", "Total Fares", "Average Fare per Ride", "Average Fare per Driver" for each city type: Rural, Suburban and Urban. This information was then used to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

## Results

The first portion of this project, the summary data, showed that although the “Total Fare” is higher in Urban cities, the “Average Fare per Ride" and the  "Average Fare per Driver" was higher for Rural areas.

Looking at the line plot that shows the total fare for each city type for the months of January 2019 and April 2019, there was a spike in fare in all city types around the end of February. Rural areas maintained a consistent fare throughout this four month period.

# Summary

Based on these results, it is recommended that more drivers should be added to rural areas since the average fare per ride and driver is high.

Another recommendation would be to compare the total number of divers by city type between the months of January 2019 and April 2019 to determine if there is a correlation between these two factors. 

Finally, further research needs to be done to find out why the average fare per ride and driver is higher in rural areas. We know one factor is that there are less drivers available in this area but will distance affect these outcomes?
